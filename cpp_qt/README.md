# CPP_QT

The CPP QT example is used as base reference: QT is a mature library with a good support for MVC patterns.

So every other approach should be very good for comparing favourably against QT example.

C++ is not a very user-friendly language, but QT gives some useful base classes, and a SIGNAL and SLOT behaviour, partially similar to declarative FRP programming.
